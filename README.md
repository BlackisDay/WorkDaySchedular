Hello and welcome to my Work Day Schedular. This work day schedular will store what ever data you put and save it into the localStorage. Also for each hour within the Work Day Schedule, it will change red to that current hour, green to the future hours, and gray to past hours. If it is only gray it means the current time that you are in is past the 9am-5pm. If you don't believe me try it during one of those hours. But other than that you are able to check your localStorage by Inspecting the element. Once you inspect the element, go into your application which you can find to the right of memory which is located right here below.

Once you're in your application click on localStorage and you should see whatever text you saved by clicking the saveButton.
